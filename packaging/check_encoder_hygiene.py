"""Prove, via real compiler-AST inspection (libclang), that no PUBLIC
declaration in EITHER of this project's two production public header sets
returns a QJsonObject/QJsonArray/QJsonValue-family type, except for a tiny,
explicitly enumerated allowlist of legitimate symbols:

  - The domain-model header set (src/domain/CardCatalog.h, ContractPin.h,
    ContractRevision.h, Decks.h, Games.h, Identifiers.h, JsonDecode.h,
    RawJson.h, ValueOrError.h -- see CMakeLists.txt's
    ARKHAM_DOMAIN_HEADERS / the arkham_domain_models target). Its only
    permitted QJson-returning symbols are the three canonical,
    production-limited exact adapters in RawJson.h
    (Value::toExactQJson/toExactQJsonObject/toExactQJsonArray) and the
    decode-direction (inbound-only, never encoding) helpers in
    JsonDecode.h.
  - The foundation header set (every other public header this build
    compiles -- networking, auth, session, keychain, input/controller UI
    glue, app composition -- see ARKHAM_FOUNDATION_HEADERS / the
    arkham_foundation target). Its only permitted QJson-returning symbols
    are AuthModels.h's two legitimate request-body encoders
    (AuthenticateRequest::toJson, RegisterRequest::toJson).

Both header sets are audited by this ONE script/policy, not just the
domain one: a review round demonstrated that scoping the AST scan to
domain headers alone left the *entire* foundation FILE_SET (including
AuthModels.h) completely unobserved, so a third undesired QJson-returning
encoder anywhere in foundation would never be caught at all.

This also replaces an earlier, source-*file*-driven version of this
script: it used to parse only the real production .cpp files as
translation units and filter cursors by whether they resolved to a
header in the domain set. That meant a header registered in the manifest
but never #include-d by any *current* .cpp was invisible to the scan
entirely -- proven by a review round that showed adding a lossy-encoder
header to the domain manifest, without changing any real source file,
produced zero findings. This script now parses every header in BOTH
manifests directly and independently: for each header path, it builds a
synthetic in-memory ("unsaved") translation unit containing nothing but
`#include "<that exact header, by absolute path>"`, using compile flags
borrowed from a real source file belonging to that header's own CMake
target (every source in one of this project's two library targets shares
identical target-level -I/-D/-std flags, verified directly against
CMakeLists.txt: neither target uses set_source_files_properties() or
per-file target_compile_definitions() to vary flags source-by-source).
This guarantees every registered header is independently, exhaustively
parsed regardless of what any .cpp currently #includes, and
clang_getFile() is used afterwards to hard-fail if the wrapper's
`#include` somehow did not resolve to the exact intended file (rather
than silently trusting that it did).

An even earlier version of this check (see git history:
tests/EncoderHygieneTests.cpp) was a purely source-text regex/parser,
which repeated review rounds proved could not keep up with an
open-ended set of textual evasions: `auto&` returns, `decltype(...)`
returns, type aliases, macro-defined return types from an
included/generated header, conversion operators, overloads/duplicate
identical class signatures colliding in a basename-keyed allowlist, and
comment/raw-string-literal desynchronization of the stripper. Every one
of those is a *textual* disguise for the exact same *semantic* fact --
"this public function's return type, after full compiler resolution of
aliases/templates/decltype/auto/macros, is in the QJson family" -- which
only a real C++ compiler frontend can determine with certainty. This
script asks Clang to determine that fact directly, via libclang's AST
(https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibClang.html), rather than re-implementing
an ever-growing fragment of C++ parsing by hand:

  - For every public function-like declaration (ordinary methods, free
    functions, conversion operators, function templates) whose *own*
    location (after macro expansion) is exactly the one header currently
    being probed, this script asks libclang for the *canonical* result
    type (i.e. with every typedef/using-alias/decltype/auto/template
    parameter already resolved to its underlying real type by the
    compiler itself) and its USR (Unified Symbol Resolution -- a stable,
    fully qualified, signature-and-overload-aware identity Clang
    computes for every declaration; see
    https://clang.llvm.org/docs/USRs.html), together with its access
    specifier and exact source file.
  - A declaration is a *violation* if its canonical return type is in the
    QJson family (QJsonObject/QJsonArray/QJsonValue, with or without a
    reference/pointer/const qualifier) and its (file, USR) pair, counted
    by *exact occurrence count*, is not one of the ALLOWLIST entries
    below. There is no general "looks like a decode helper" heuristic
    (e.g. "takes a QJson parameter, so it must be inbound-only") -- that
    itself would be a new textual/structural loophole (e.g. a lossy
    per-DTO `toJson(QJsonObject seed)` padded with an unused QJson-typed
    parameter purely to slip past such a rule). Every legitimate
    exception is named explicitly, by exact qualified USR, exact expected
    source file (a full, repo-root-relative path -- never a bare
    basename, which would incorrectly collide two different files that
    happen to share a name), and exact expected occurrence count, so
    neither a same-named symbol cloned into a different header nor a
    same-named symbol declared an unexpected number of times in its
    correct header can slip through.

No new third-party dependency is added for this: libclang is part of the
same Clang toolchain already used for clang-format elsewhere in this
project's tasks, loaded here directly via Python's built-in `ctypes`
against libclang's stable C ABI (not the unrelated, separately
pip-installed `clang`/`libclang` PyPI packages, which this script does
not use or require).

This script also independently, structurally proves the domain/
foundation *dependency direction* boundary a review round demonstrated
was not actually enforced by the compiler in the way an earlier
CMakeLists.txt revision's comments (and a since-rewritten, now-removed
compiled probe target) claimed: narrowing arkham_domain_models's public
include path to only "src/domain" blocks a *bare*
`#include "AuthModels.h"` (no `-I src` left to search), but it never
blocked -- and cannot block, no matter how include paths are narrowed --
a *relative-parent* `#include "../AuthModels.h"` written inside a file
that itself lives in src/domain/, because quote-form #include always
searches relative to the including file's own directory *before*
consulting any `-I`/FILE_SET path at all. The same is true of an
absolute-path #include, or a same-directory symlink whose target
happens to resolve outside src/domain/. None of these are blockable by
any compile-flag/include-path configuration; they can only be caught by
inspecting what a header's #include actually, truly resolved to.

So, for every header/fragment in BOTH manifests, this script also asks
libclang for the *complete resolved inclusion graph* of that header's
own wrapper translation unit (via `clang_getInclusions()` -- see
https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibClang.html -- which reports every file
the compiler actually entered, transitively, no matter how the
#include that reached it was spelled: bare, "../"-relative, absolute,
via a symlink, or via a project-generated wrapper header) and requires
every *project-owned* file that graph reaches (i.e. every included file
whose own canonicalized, symlink-resolved real path lies inside this
repository's tracked source tree -- anything outside it entirely, such
as a Qt/system/toolchain header, is unconditionally external and
exempt) to be a member of the closure this script was told is
legitimate for the header currently being probed. "This repository's
tracked source tree" deliberately excludes this script's own dedicated
Clang-toolchain build directory (see _configure_clang_build_dir() and
_audit_inclusion_graph()): that directory is, by default, physically
nested inside the repository itself, and CMake's FetchContent (see
CMakeLists.txt's QtKeychain declaration) downloads/builds genuinely
external third-party source and generated build artifacts directly
under it -- none of that is this repository's own tracked source,
merely a byproduct of where this check happens to configure its
scratch build, and must be classified exactly like any other external
header:

  - Scanning a DOMAIN header/fragment: the only permitted project-owned
    included files are other members of the domain closure itself
    (ARKHAM_DOMAIN_HEADERS + ARKHAM_DOMAIN_FRAGMENTS) -- reaching
    *anything* foundation-owned (AuthModels.h or otherwise), by any
    spelling whatsoever, is a hard structural violation. This is the
    domain -> foundation direction the review round showed must be
    forbidden.
  - Scanning a FOUNDATION header/fragment: the domain closure is
    additionally permitted (foundation -> domain is the allowed
    direction; arkham_foundation legitimately links
    arkham_domain_models), but nothing else project-owned/unregistered
    is -- an unregistered fragment, a project-generated header outside
    both closures, etc. is still a hard structural violation there too.

Every declared entry in every manifest is also independently required
to resolve (after following any symlink) to a real path *physically
located inside its own claimed root* (src/domain/ for every domain
entry, src/ for every foundation entry) before any of the above even
runs -- this is what stops a same-named symlink smuggled directly into
one of the manifests itself (rather than merely #include-d from
elsewhere) from silently widening a closure to include a file it does
not actually, physically contain.

Since a header's own declarations may now legitimately be discovered
while scanning a *different* header's wrapper TU (e.g. Decks.h's
wrapper TU also enters ValueOrError.h, which Decks.h legitimately
#includes), every declaration is attributed to its own true resolved
source file (never to whichever header's wrapper TU happened to reach
it) and recorded in one global, whole-run (file, line, USR) dedup set,
so a legitimately shared/cross-included file's declarations are counted
exactly once no matter how many other headers in its own closure
#include it -- never once per including header.
