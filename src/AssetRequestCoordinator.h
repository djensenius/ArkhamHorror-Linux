// Orchestrates one logical asset request end-to-end: resolve candidates
// (AssetLocator), consult the cache (AssetCache), and -- on a miss --
// fetch over the network (AssetNetworkFetcher), advancing through the
// candidate list only on a definitive 404 exactly as AssetLocator
// documents, and never on Transport/RedirectRejected/UnexpectedStatus/
// ResponseTooLarge/ContentTypeMismatch/MagicBytesMismatch/DimensionTooLarge/
// PixelBudgetExceeded/UnsupportedCodec/MalformedImage/Cancelled.
//
// Concurrent identical requests (same cache key, derived from the SAME
// resolved candidate -- see AssetCache::cacheKeyFor()) are coalesced: a
// second request() for a key already in flight attaches as an additional
// consumer of the same underlying operation rather than issuing a second
// network fetch. Each consumer receives its own opaque RequestHandle.
//
// Cancellation/destruction semantics:
//   - cancel(handle) detaches exactly that one consumer. Its own callback
//     is invoked exactly once, with AssetErrorCode::Cancelled, and never
//     again afterwards.
//   - Other consumers of the same coalesced operation are entirely
//     unaffected by one consumer's cancellation: the underlying fetch
//     keeps running and still completes normally for them.
//   - Only when the LAST remaining consumer of an operation cancels (or
//     the coordinator itself is destroyed) is the underlying
//     AssetNetworkFetcher fetch actually aborted.
//   - A reply belonging to an operation that has since been fully
//     cancelled/superseded can never invoke any consumer's callback: the
//     operation is removed from the pending map before the underlying
//     cancel/abort is issued, exactly mirroring
//     NetworkAuthenticationClient's disconnect-before-abort ordering.
